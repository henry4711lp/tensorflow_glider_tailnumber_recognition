# Tensorflow Glider Tail Number Recognition

This is a simple Tensorflow program, that tries to identify Glider Tail Numbers beginning with a single Letter following a "-" and 4 numbers e.g. D-1234.

TODO:\
    - Integration of webcam scanning car plate \
    - Integration of webstream/stream \
    - Getting Data from a pre recognized glider cutout \
    - combining data with FLARM \
    - combining data with glidernet.org \
    - pushing data into vereinsflieger.de \
    - lowering the workload to work on raspberrypi and not taking 100 years

Feel free to contact me for collaboration ;)
